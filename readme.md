### Project Details

The Bankist Landing Page project aims to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing website for a modern bank. It incorporates various interactive and dynamic elements to enhance the user experience. Below, you'll find the key features and visual effects implemented in this project:

- **Navigation:** When hovering over a navigation link, the other items fade out, providing a clear visual indication of the selected link.

- **Smooth Scroll:** When clicking on a navigation link, the page automatically scrolls to the targeted section with a smooth transition, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Section Fade-In:** As you scroll down the page, each section gradually appears and moves up, creating an engaging and visually appealing effect.

- **Lazy Image Loading:** While scrolling down the page, images are loaded lazily. Initially, a blurred version of the image is displayed, and as you scroll, the blur is replaced with high-quality images. This technique helps improve page loading performance and user experience.

- **Tab Component:** The project includes a custom tab component implemented from scratch. It allows users to switch between different content sections, enhancing the page's interactivity.

- **Slider Component:** The project includes a slider component, complete with next and previous buttons, dot indicators for slide navigation, keyboard arrow key support for changing slides, and an automatic timer that transitions between slides every 5 seconds. This component serves as a dynamic and visually engaging way to display customer testimonials.

- **Modal Window:** Clicking a button triggers the opening of a modal window containing a sign-up form. This interactive element encourages user engagement.

- **Responsive Design:** The Bankist landing page is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and phones. The responsive design ensures a consistent experience for all users.
